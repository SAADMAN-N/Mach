## 2. Projects Section - Already Covered ✅

You've already added the Mach project entry, which is perfect.

## 3. Skills to Highlight in Experience Section

If you want to emphasize new skills in your existing experience section, you could add:

**For Undergraduate Learning Assistant:**
- Mention if you've used any code analysis tools or helped students understand large codebases

**For Embedded Systems TA:**
- Already strong, no major updates needed

## 4. Consider Adding (Optional Sections)

### Technical Competencies (if you have space):

```
Vector Search & Semantic Search
• Implemented 768-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic code search
• Built cosine similarity algorithms with pgvector for context-aware retrieval
• Designed scalable similarity search systems with PostgreSQL

AI/ML Integration
• Integrated multiple LLM APIs (OpenRouter, Google Gemini, OpenAI)
• Built real-time streaming AI responses
• Automated code summarization and analysis workflows

Full-Stack Architecture
• Designed end-to-end type-safe APIs with tRPC
• Implemented server-first architecture with Next.js Server Components
• Built parallel processing pipelines with error resilience
```

### Key Achievements (if relevant):

If you have quantifiable metrics from Mach:
- "Processed X repositories with Y files indexed"
- "Reduced codebase onboarding time by X%"
- "Implemented vector search with X-dimensional embeddings"
- "Built Q&A system with X% accuracy"

## 5. Keywords for ATS Optimization

Make sure these terms appear somewhere in your resume (in skills, projects, or experience):

**High-Value Keywords:**
- Vector embeddings
- Semantic search
- pgvector
- tRPC
- LangChain
- AssemblyAI
- Cosine similarity
- End-to-end type safety
- Server Components
- React Query
- Parallel processing
- Real-time streaming

**Action Verbs to Use:**
- Architected
- Engineered
- Implemented
- Designed
- Developed
- Built
- Integrated

## 6. Interview Talking Points

Be ready to discuss these technical details from Mach:

**Vector Search:**
- How you chose 768 dimensions (Gemini embedding model standard)
- Why cosine similarity over other distance metrics
- How you determined the 0.5 similarity threshold
- Performance considerations for large codebases

**Architecture:**
- Why tRPC over REST APIs (type safety, developer experience)
- Server Components vs Client Components (when to use each)
- How React Query simplifies server state management
- Parallel processing with Promise.allSettled vs Promise.all

**AI Integration:**
- Why OpenRouter for LLM access (flexibility, cost)
- How you handle streaming responses
- Error handling for AI API failures
- Context building from multiple code files

## 7. Resume Length Consideration

Since you're on a 1-page resume, prioritize:

1. **Must Add:**
   - tRPC (significant differentiator)
   - Vector embeddings / Semantic search
   - pgvector (shows ML/AI database skills)

2. **Should Add:**
   - LangChain
   - AssemblyAI
   - React Query

3. **Nice to Have:**
   - OpenRouter SDK
   - Cosine similarity algorithms
   - Server Components (if space)

**Recommendation:** Add the top 3-5 most impactful technologies. The Mach project entry already demonstrates many of these technologies in context, so you don't need to list every single one in the skills section.

## 8. Summary of Changes

### Highest Priority Updates:

1. ✅ **Add to Skills:** `tRPC`, `pgvector`, `Vector embeddings`, `Semantic search`
2. ✅ **Add to Skills:** `LangChain`, `AssemblyAI`, `React Query`
3. ✅ **Update Project Entry:** Already done (Mach project)
4. ✅ **Keywords:** Ensure AI/ML keywords appear naturally throughout resume

### Example Final Skills Section:

```
Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL

Frameworks & Libraries: React, Next.js, Express.js, Flask, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Socket.io, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, Prisma, React Query, LangChain

Developer Tools: Node.js, Git, Docker, AWS, Google Cloud, VS Code, Firebase, Clerk Auth, Stripe API, JWT

Databases & APIs: PostgreSQL, pgvector, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, OpenRouter SDK, AssemblyAI, Vapi Voice Agents

AI/ML: Vector embeddings, Semantic search, Cosine similarity algorithms, LLM integration
```

---

**Key Takeaway:** The Mach project demonstrates advanced skills in AI/ML, vector search, and modern full-stack architecture. Highlighting `tRPC`, `pgvector`, and `vector embeddings` in your skills section will significantly strengthen your resume, as these are highly sought-after technologies in the current market.
